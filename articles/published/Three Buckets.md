I've played a number of games with variable victory conditions where players are focused on different aspects of the game (L5R). Asymmetric games are some of my favorites (Netrunner). It's a great way to introduce a depth that racing to a single goal just doesn't provide the same way.

When I first started playing Lorcana, my first critique was how simple the battlefield was. There's one life total, and everyone plays creatures. How droll. As I've come to learn more about the game, I see how very simplistic my initial evaluation is. I've walked through a few theories

### Failed Theory 1: Lore is king
My first pass at this game, I just tapped everything for lore all the time. This works up to a point, but I'm sure anyone who's played more than a handful of games has lost a game where they are up 18 to 2. Everything's going well, but those last 2 points just aren't getting you there? What happened?

### Failed Theory 2: Cards. Cards. Cards
After losing consistently with higher lore than my opponent for most of the game, I moved onto playing red purple. A deck that can quest reasonably well, but more importantly it can out card draw almost any deck in the game (there's some context around whole new world, but a separate thought).  I was doing great drawing all of the cards and just winning games. Until I kept going up against the red amber mufasa decks.

### Failed Theory 3: Board Advantage
If you can't beat them, join them. I picked up Red Yellow Mufasa, sure I had unlocked the equation to this game. Just maintain my board presence, and over power them with value like hades and Mufasa with good body guards like Simba. This resulted in me falling all the way back to the bottom of Silver. What happened?

### Back to the drawing board
What I recognized playing against the Mufasa deck as Red Purple is that I'd be ahead on cards, drastically. I'd be tied at a mid life total, and then the board position would get taken away from me. I'd draw more cards to dig to be prepared and it wouldn't help. When I was playing the Mufasa deck, I'd be tied on lore and way ahead on board control. After a series of Genies or Flynns I'd eventually lose what I felt was a clear advantage and turn it into a solid loss. 

This happened for each of the theories that I was trying to use. The game isn't about any of those things. It's about all of them.
### Current Theory: Buckets
Let's play a game. We each have 3 hidden buckets: A, B, C. We each have 7 stones to put in those buckets. After all stones are secretly places, we reveal our buckets. If you have more than I do in any two buckets, you win. How do you distribute your stones?If you know nothing, the decisions are more or less arbitrary. But if you think I'm putting 6 beads in A, you can ignore that bucket and focus on winning B and C. If you know I'm ignoring A, can you sneakily put just one in A instead? 

Just like rock-paper-scissors, it's really hard to develop a genuinely interesting scenario. But also, just like rock-paper-scissors, we can use a simple game as a template for how we think about a game that's far more complex. 

Using the model above, I think Lorcana has three buckets, all of which are my failed theories above. The truth is that all of them matter. Not in a everyone-gets-a-trophy kind of mattering, but a genuine this-is-who-wins kind of way. Let me describe my three buckets for shared vocabulary.
#### The Three Buckets:
- Card Advantage: Total number of choices available. This includes total ink + cards in hand compared to your opponent. This is highly relative.

- Lore Advantage: This is two related stats. Total lore and turns-to-Twenty (Tt20). Tt20 is critically important to calculate properly. 

- Board Advantage: How much force/staying power do you have on the board. This is the most subjective and depends largely on the matchup. 
### Examples

AmberRed Mufasa vs RedPurple Control
- Cards: RP is almost always winning on raw number of cards. AmberRed drawing  with Rapunzel is never thing, but rarely matters in the larger scope. Friends on the other side doesn't help as much as it does in other matches.
- Board: AmberRed will always control the board. Mufasas and hades replace themselves, Simba makes things awkard for the rush characters, and the little bit of ramp with doc/lanterns keeps them ahead. RP should concede this battlefield.
- Lore: Amber Red has a better Lore game with printed cards. Lore is much more important than cards or board advantage, so RP should make sure to hamstring the Amber player's lore as much as possible

Blue Steel Whole New World vs RedPurple Control
- Cards: Blue Steel is the only deck red purple cannot out draw (in my experience). RP can even consider inking friends on the other side. Every point spent fighting this axis is wasted from RP. 
- Board: Both decks have access to a board wipe, with Blue Steel's being weaker but only one sided. This creates a delightful tension between the players to make sure one player doesn't pull too far ahead.
- Lore: Both decks struggle to gain high amounts of Lore until the end game (depending on the RP build). This is usually a tie, but if a player is ignoring it entirely, this can be exploited.
### Conclusion
In this theory, it's important to identify which axis' you're investing in, and which places don't matter, often because you've already won/lost.  This three way balance of power is what subtly makes the game very dynamic. 

Which of these matters changes many times over the game and aren't hard and fast rules. An amber player getting a good Rapunzel/Mother Gothel (fighting on a losing front) does require the RP to invest in that same front. This has the added bonus of making a player misjudge the importance of cards vs lore vs presence.
