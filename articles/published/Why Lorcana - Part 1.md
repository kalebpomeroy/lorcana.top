At face value, Lorcana is incredibly simple. There are creatures, with power, toughness and mana cost. Your colors pie has 6 instead of 5 but it looks the same on the table. Mechanically, it shares a large percentage with Hearthstone, Magic and a dozen other variants. There's few things that really stand out as new and novel. So what makes the game interesting?

I've taught a lot of people how to play magic - probably not 100 but close to it. I have a very clear script around how to teach the game, what to gloss over and what to not even try to talk about. We can talk about phases and turn order, but we'll ignore the stack for now. Once you get a few games under your belt I'll describe how instants work and why I can draw cards even though you have that kill spell. After that we'll talk about the nuance of countering vs exiling a spell and how I get to counter your uncounterable card with Reprieve but not Remand. This complexity isn't even getting into the current set's keywords, the plethora of formats you can play and the different deck building rules, or gods forbid, layers.

Disclaimer: To magic's credit, it's been around three decades. That's a LONG time for a game to be around. It's not quite fair to compare a game that launched in 2023 with a game from before cell phones were really popular.

When learning any game, there's two different learning curves. The first step is "how do I play?". This phase of the learning is about card types, phases, and mechanics. Modern Euro board games have hour+ long explanations explaining all of the different ways you can use your influence to buy wigs to pay for your workers. A huge part of the cognitive load of these games is in this space. (this happens to be my favorite kind of board games) 

Games like splendor or chess teach the mechanics in just a few minutes. Those games thrive in the complexity of the emergent properties of the mechanics, rather than mechanics themselves. 

Euro games, many RPGs and most card games take the approach of complexity of mechanics to create diverse and interesting lists/builds/strategies. Lorcana, up to this point, has chosen to focus on the depth of play with very few unique options. There are many characters that are exact functional duplicates, just in another color.  The risk here is that the game is simply boring or flat. It's hard to make an interesting game with boring pieces. But as any experienced Lorcana player can attest to, the difference between a one drop 1/3 and a one drop 1/2 is VERY different. The nuance of the numbers makes every tiny shift in the game different.
